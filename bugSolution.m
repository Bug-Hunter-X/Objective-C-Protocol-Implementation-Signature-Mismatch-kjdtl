The solution is to ensure a precise match between the protocol method signature and its implementation.  Correcting the implementation to match the protocol definition resolves the issue:

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethodWithParam:(NSString *)param {
    // Correct Implementation - note the space between the parameter type and the asterisk
}
@end
```
This seemingly minor change prevents the runtime error by ensuring that the compiler correctly links the protocol method to its implementation.
